### Task 1 Reconnaissance - Deploy the machine

### 1.1 - Deploy the machine

ðŸŽ¯ Target IP: `10.10.33.26`

Create a directory for machine on the Desktop and a directory containing the scans with nmap.

```bash
su
echo "10.10.33.26 blue.thm" >> /etc/hosts

mkdir thm/blue
cd thm/blue

# At the end of the room
# To clean up the last line from the /etc/hosts file
sed -i '$ d' /etc/hosts
```

I prefer to start recon by pinging the target, this allows us to check connectivity and get OS info.

```bash
ping -c 3 blue.thm
```

```bash
PING blue.thm (10.10.33.26) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from blue.thm (10.10.33.26): icmp_seq=1 ttl=127 time=73.9 ms
64 bytes from blue.thm (10.10.33.26): icmp_seq=2 ttl=127 time=70.3 ms
64 bytes from blue.thm (10.10.33.26): icmp_seq=3 ttl=127 time=75.1 ms
```

Sending these three ICMP packets, we see that the Time To Live (TTL) is \~128 secs. this indicates that the target is a windows system, while \*nix systems usually have a TTL of 64 secs.

#### 1.2 - How many services are running under port 1000?

```bash
nmap -p1-1000 --open -sS -n -Pn blue.thm -oG open_ports
```

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-05 19:35 CEST
Nmap scan report for blue.thm (10.10.33.26)
Host is up (0.069s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE

139/tcp open  netbios-ssn

```

> 3 ports open under port 1000

#### 1.3 - What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)

```bash
nmap -p135,139,445 -sV -sC -vvv -n -Pn blue.thm
```

```bash
