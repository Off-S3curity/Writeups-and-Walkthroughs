<details>

<summary>What is a SQL Injection?</summary>

SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code into user-input fields or other parameters. This can happen when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs before constructing SQL queries.

SQL injection attacks are most common in web applications that interact with a database. When user inputs are directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper validation, an attacker can input specially crafted strings that alter the intended logic of the SQL query.
